# Force Robolectric to test using Android SDK 28, instead of 29
# This warning still displays:
# [Robolectric] WARN: Android SDK 29 requires Java 9 (have Java 8). Tests won't be run on SDK 29 unless explicitly requested.
# But at least the test will run.
# See https://stackoverflow.com/a/59649406/967131
# Without this, tests will fail with errors like this:
# java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Failed to create a Robolectric sandbox: Android SDK 29 requires Java 9 (have Java 8)
# The alternative would be to install JRE 9 on the development machine and alter the unit test run/debug
# configuration to use it. This solution is simpler and more transferable, making it easier to run
# on varied machines. If development were to continue on this project long-term, the solution could be
# revisited in the future, when a better solution may exist.
